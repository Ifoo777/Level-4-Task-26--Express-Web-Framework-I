    <p>
      A Privacy Policy is a document where you disclose what personal data you
      collect from your website's visitors, how you collect it, how you use it
      and other important details about your privacy practices.<br /><br />

      In this post, we'll take a look at what Privacy Policies are and why you
      likely need to have one posted on your website. We'll also go over some
      important clauses that are useful to include in your Privacy Policy.
      Finally, we'll look at how different websites display their Privacy
      Policies.<br /><br />

      Privacy Policies are legally binding agreements you are required to post
      on your website if you're collecting any sort of personal information from
      your site's visitors or customers.<br /><br />

      A Privacy Policy is an important legal document that lets users understand
      the various ways a website might be collecting personal information. The
      purpose of a Privacy Policy is to inform users of your data collection
      practices in order to protect the customer's privacy.<br /><br />

      Your Privacy Policy should disclose how the website/app collects
      information, how the information is used, whether or not it is shared with
      third parties and how it is protected and stored.<br /><br />

      There are 3 main reasons for having a Privacy Policy: (1) you're required
      by law, (2) you're required by third party services, (3) you want to be
      transparent.
