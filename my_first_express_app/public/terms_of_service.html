    <h2>What is a Terms of Service Agreement?</h2>
    <p>
      A Terms of Service agreement is the legal document that helps you set out
      the rules and guidelines that your users or visitors must agree to in
      order to use your website or app, such as:<br /><br />

      Not stealing your content and violating copyright laws<br />
      Not spamming other users<br />
      Not using your site for illegal activities<br />
      These agreements are commonly abbreviated as ToS and are also referred to
      as a Terms and Conditions, Terms of Use, Conditions of Use, or User
      Agreement.<br /><br />

      Regardless of what you call your Terms of Service, the aim of the
      agreement is the same:<br /><br />

      Disclose the rules and restrictions that your users must adhere to<br />
      Maintain your right to terminate abusive accounts<br />
      Make your copyright, trademark and intellectual property rights known<br />
      Limit your liability<br />
      Disclaim warranties<br />
      Depending on the nature of your business, your ToS may also need clauses
      that cover:<br /><br />

      Payment terms<br />
      Subscription information<br />
      Licensing rights<br />
      Customer support<br />
      User-generated content
